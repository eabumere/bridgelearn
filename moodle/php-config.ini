; Suppress all deprecation warnings and notices (still log them, just don't display)
; This hides PHP 8.4 deprecation notices while keeping real errors visible
; The E_STRICT constant is deprecated in PHP 8.4, causing these warnings
; Completely suppress error display in browser while still logging them
