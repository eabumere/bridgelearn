🎓 Frontend Module Specification – iTutor-Like Platform (Vite + React + TypeScript + WebRTC + Redux Toolkit)
🧱 Project Context

This is a Vite-based React (TypeScript) frontend for an interactive online tutoring platform similar to iTutor.
It enables real-time teaching sessions with video conferencing (WebRTC), whiteboard collaboration, stickers and rewards, and live chat between teachers, students, and tech support.

🧩 LiveClassroom Components
1. VideoContainer.tsx

WebRTC-based video grid for teachers and students.

Handles:

Media stream setup via RTK actions (startSession, toggleCamera, toggleMic)

Screen sharing toggle

Video quality switch (Low / Medium / High / HD)

Displays logo and background customization (blur, solid color, uploaded image).

2. Whiteboard.tsx

Collaborative canvas with drawing, writing, and annotations.

Tools: pen, eraser, color, text, shapes, undo/redo.

Real-time sync via WebRTC data channels or Socket.IO.

Whiteboard actions (e.g., draw, clear, save) managed through Redux to ensure deterministic state updates.

3. Reactions.tsx

Panel for stickers, applause, and rewards:

Stickers: “👏”, “👍”, “🔥”, “Great Job!”

Rewards: Increment points or badges via reactionSlice actions.

Animated claps using Framer Motion.

Redux ensures all connected clients receive synchronized reactions.

4. ChatPanel.tsx

Two-tab chat interface:

Class Chat: Real-time teacher ↔ student communication.

Tech Support: For support conversations.

Backed by Socket.IO and Redux chatSlice.

Includes role badges, timestamps, and persistence via /api/classroom.ts.

5. SupportButton.tsx

Floating button that opens tech support chat modal.

Uses RTK actions like openSupportModal() and sendSupportMessage().

🧮 Redux Toolkit Store Structure
Slice	Purpose	Key Actions
userSlice	Authenticated user data (via AWS Cognito)	setUser, logout, updateProfile
classroomSlice	Live session, media state, participants	startSession, endSession, toggleCamera, setVideoQuality
chatSlice	Handles messages and support chat	sendMessage, receiveMessage, loadChatHistory
reactionSlice	Stickers, claps, and reward points	sendReaction, addReward, clearReactions
uiSlice	UI modals, theme mode, background settings	toggleDarkMode, setBackground, openModal

✅ Use createAsyncThunk for async actions (e.g., message sending, file upload).
✅ Configure the store in store/index.ts with configureStore() and Provider wrapping App.tsx.

⚙️ Utilities & APIs

auth.ts → AWS Cognito integration (sign-in, sign-up, token refresh).

apiClient.ts → Axios instance with interceptors (JWT + 401 handling).

s3Uploader.ts → Uploads lesson resources to AWS S3.

env.ts → Contains WebRTC STUN/TURN configuration, API URLs, and S3 credentials.

🎨 Tech Stack

Framework: React + Vite + TypeScript

State Management: Redux Toolkit + Redux Thunk

UI Library: Tailwind CSS + ShadCN/UI

Animations: Framer Motion

Real-time: WebRTC + Socket.IO

Auth: AWS Cognito

File Storage: AWS S3

✨ Design & UX Vibe

Clean, modern, and educational.

Balanced between a classroom and game-like environment (interactive but professional).

Use rounded corners, subtle shadows, animated feedback, and clear typography.
